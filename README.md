This is  a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) application that allows users to create update and delete study "cards".

The application allows users to log in with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) authentication to save any changes made to the cards. Any changes made
while not logged in will be saved to local storage.
## Getting Started
* Run npm install to install all packages
* Follow the [installation steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) for firebase
